## 🎉 **Introduction**

Welcome to **CoinCast**, a lightweight blockchain implementation designed to simulate the core functionalities of Bitcoin. Whether you're a developer or a blockchain enthusiast, CoinCast provides a flexible and educational platform to explore:

- 🛠️ **Miners**: Connect and exchange messages via a central WebSocket server.
- 💼 **Wallets**: Generate and manage Bitcoin-like wallets.
- 🔐 **Transactions**: Create, sign, and broadcast transactions.
- 🔗 **Blockchain**: Verify, validate, and propagate blocks across the network.

## ✨ **Features**

- 🔄 **Central Server**: A WebSocket-based server that connects all miners for seamless message exchange.
- 🛠️ **Miner Server**: Build blocks, perform proof-of-work, and broadcast them to the network.
- 📝 **Blockchain Verification**: Code that verifies signatures, balances, and rejects erroneous blocks.
- ⚙️ **Automatic Blockchain Sync**: Miners catch up to the blockchain on startup, ensuring consistent network state.
- 🖥️ **Frontend Interface**: User-friendly React app to create wallets, sign transactions, and submit them to the network.

## 🏗️ **Architecture**

1. **Central WebSocket Server**:  
   - Manages real-time communication between all connected miners.
   - Distributes blocks and transactions across the network.

2. **Miner Servers**:  
   - Perform proof-of-work, create blocks, and broadcast them via the central server.
   - Use verification mechanisms to maintain blockchain integrity.

3. **Frontend Application**:  
   - React-based UI to interact with the blockchain.
   - Create wallets, sign transactions, and submit them to miners.

4. **RPC Server**:  
   - Provides a standardized API for miners and the frontend to interact with the blockchain.
   - Enables querying blockchain state, submitting transactions, and adding blocks.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

- **Backend**: Node.js (WebSocket, Express, RPC)
- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: In-memory storage for balance tracking (optional: upgrade to a persistent DB)
- **Communication**: WebSocket, HTTP (RPC)
- **Blockchain**: Custom implementation (UTXO-based for future improvements)

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CoinCast.git
   cd CoinCast
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the servers**:
   - **Central WebSocket Server**:
     ```bash
     node centralServer.js
     ```
   - **Miner Server**:
     ```bash
     node minerServer.js
     ```
   - **Frontend**:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm start
     ```

4. **Interact with the network**:  
   Access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000` and start interacting with the blockchain!

## 💡 **Usage**

1. **Creating a Wallet**:  
   Use the frontend to generate a wallet with a public/private key pair.

2. **Signing Transactions**:  
   Sign transactions using your wallet and send them to a miner for processing.

3. **Mining**:  
   Run a miner server to participate in block creation and verification.

4. **Blockchain State**:  
   Query the current blockchain state via the RPC server.
